# üßÅ Food Explorer
<p>
  Rocketseat's final challenge.
</p>

<p>
  Here I learned more about NodeJs, SQL, React and the integration of front and back-end.
</p>

## Before running ‚ùóÔ∏è 

<p>
  Make sure to open your terminal and execute `npm install --force`.
  Because I've used Carousel, you have to `--force` the installation.
  After that, you can execute `npm run dev`. 
</p>
<p>
For local experience you'll have to download the API located on the repo https://github.com/henriquekishida/Food-Explorer-API, aswell execute `npm install` and
 `npm run dev`. Don't forget to change the baseURL (located on src/services/api.js) to http://localhost:3000
